## Getting Started

### **Crypto Analyse**

#### **Problem Statement -** 

Build a dataset of crypto prices over time by scraping it from any crypto portal.
Now use this dataset and do basic analysis on it and answer the following questions:

1. What is the average price of Bitcoin over the last 30 days?
2. What is the average price of Ethereum over the last 30 days?
3. What is the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum over the last 30 days?
4. Are there any outliers in the data? If yes, what are they and why do you think
   they are outliers?
5. Are there any patterns in the data? If yes, what are they and why do you think
   they are patterns?
   Now push the data to a cloud storage (AWS S3 or GCP Storage).

#### **Brief -**

The code is divided into 2 files -

1. utility.py - this contains all main functions
2. runner.py - this runs the particular function as per use case

## Requirements

* .env file with following AWS settings -

```
ACCESS_KEY = 'xxxxxx'
SECRET_KEY = 'xxxxxx'

```

* Checkout and install requirements.txt file for python library requirements

## Installation

After fullfiling above requrements -

1. Pull whole repository to Machine
2. Setup AWS S3 resource and create access keys
3. The runner.py file has all you need. Just run it!

## Usage with examples
